# Brick ML

**Brick ML** is my attempt to better understand simple neural networks by implementing them *from scratch*. 

> **Note**: Progress is currently being slowed down due to insufficient computing power.

## Overview

This project aims to provide a hands-on learning experience by building neural networks without relying on high-level libraries.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and install the required packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed. You can install the necessary packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
